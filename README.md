##Introduction
This project provides a basic implementation of a blockchain in Java. It includes core functionalities such as block creation, mining, and validation. The project is intended for educational purposes to help understand the workings of blockchain technology.

##Components
#Block.java
The Block class represents an individual block in the blockchain.

1.Attributes:
hash: The hash of the current block.
previousHash: The hash of the previous block.
data: The data stored in the block.
timeStamp: The timestamp when the block was created.
nonce: A counter used in the mining process.
2.Methods:
calculateHash(): Computes the SHA-256 hash of the block.
mineBlock(int difficulty): Mines the block by finding a hash that meets the difficulty requirement.
#NewCoin.java
The NewCoin class manages the blockchain and contains the main application logic.

1.Attributes:
blockchain: An array list of Block objects representing the chain.
difficulty: The difficulty level for mining new blocks.
2.Methods:
isChainValid(): Validates the integrity of the blockchain.
main(String[] args): Creates, mines, and validates blocks, and prints the blockchain in JSON format.
#StringUtil.java
The StringUtil class provides utility functions, particularly for hashing.

1.Methods:
applySha256(String input): Applies the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to a string and returns the resulting hash.
##How It Works
1.Block Creation:

A block is created with specific data and the hash of the previous block. The current block’s hash is calculated using its data, previous hash, timestamp, and a nonce.
2.Mining:

The mineBlock method adjusts the nonce and recalculates the block’s hash until it meets the difficulty requirement (a certain number of leading zeros).
3.Blockchain Management:

The NewCoin class maintains an array list of blocks and provides functionality to add new blocks, mine them, and validate the entire chain’s integrity.
4.Validation:

The isChainValid method checks each block’s hash against its calculated hash and ensures the previousHash field matches the previous block's hash, maintaining the chain’s consistency and immutability.
##Getting Started
#Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
A code editor or IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
#Installation
1.Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd your-repository-name
#Usage
1.Compile the Java files:
sh
Copy code
javac *.java
2.Run the main class:
sh
Copy code
java NewCoin
##Key Concepts
1.Hashing: Ensures data integrity by producing a unique hash for each block.
2.Proof of Work (Mining): Demonstrates the computational effort required to add a new block to the blockchain.
3.Chain Validation: Ensures the blockchain’s integrity by verifying each block’s hash and its link to the previous block.
##Enhancements
While this project effectively demonstrates basic blockchain concepts, real-world blockchains include additional features such as:

1.Transaction handling
2.Digital signatures
3.More complex consensus algorithms
4.Enhanced security measures
